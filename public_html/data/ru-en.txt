A woman with a cart - the mare is easier
Grandma wondered, half said
The trouble never comes alone
Without a cat mice will play
Not easily pull the fish out of the pond
Better safe than sorry
God loves a trinity
Sated belly, but my eyes are hungry
East or west home is best
At the foot there is no truth
The family has its black sheep
Still waters run deep
In another man's wife fuck spoon of honey puts
Fun fun - hard hangover
Fear of wolves - in the woods do not go
Everyone cricket stick to his last
The eyes are afraid, but the hands are doing
Necessity is the mother of invention
Leopard change his spots
Affectionate calf sucks two queens
Better to see once than hear a hundred times
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Man will know when to him a peck of salt you eat
What would the child have anything he wants, he does not cry
Garlic and onions - from seven disease.
