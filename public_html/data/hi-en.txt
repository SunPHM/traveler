To cast pearls before swine
Pleasant distant drum
Familiarity breeds contempt
Homemade horror piercing Lanka
Under water, but hated
Barking dogs seldom bite
Equally foot cloth Pasaro
Hundred Goldsmith, a blacksmith
If life is the macrocosm
Which saw the peacock dance in the woods?
That sticks to the Buffalo
Daye home piercing Lanka
What's happening now when the bird devoured him to the farm
Nine hundred and mouse template cat went to Hajj
Had what RC bracelet
Do not make a mountain out of a molehill
Deep rivers should Clkt
In the blind-eyed king
All's well that ends well
Should not believe the same fate at the hands of the lines, so they are not too whose hands
When Lakshmi do Tilak, then should not wash
If the treatment was not to doubt Luqman Hakim
No two swords in a sheath Smatin
Do not let the courtyard sinuous dance
Familiarity breeds contempt
